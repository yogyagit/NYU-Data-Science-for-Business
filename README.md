### Homework Descriptions

#### 1. Predictive Modeling for Graduate Admissions (`ys5250_HW1/ys5250_HW1.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Assist a university admissions department in forecasting applicant success to optimize their selection process and resource allocation.

**Business Impact**:
- **Strategic Enrollment Management**: Enhances the ability to predict student success and fit, guiding admissions strategy.
- **Resource Optimization**: Improves planning for campus resources, such as housing and class sizes, based on predicted enrollment figures.
- **Market Positioning**: Helps the university position itself in the academic market by attracting and admitting students who are more likely to succeed and contribute to the university's reputation.

**Key Data Science Techniques**:
- Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for binary classification.
- ROC Curves for model evaluation to balance sensitivity and specificity.
- Statistical methods to interpret model outputs and infer which factors most significantly impact admissions.

#### 2. Analysis of No-Shows at Medical Appointments (`ys5250_HW2/ys5250_HW2.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Predict and mitigate patient no-shows at medical appointments to enhance operational efficiency and patient care quality.

**Business Impact**:
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces gaps in scheduling, allowing for better staff and resource management.
- **Financial Performance**: Decreases financial losses due to missed appointments and optimizes revenue cycles.
- **Patient Satisfaction and Retention**: Improves patient throughput and service availability, enhancing patient satisfaction and retention.

**Key Data Science Techniques**:
- Advanced feature engineering from historical appointment data to capture underlying patterns.
- Ensemble methods like Random Forests for robust predictive accuracy.
- Profit curve analysis to evaluate the financial implications of various intervention strategies.

#### 3. Strategies for Reducing Customer Churn at TelCo (`ys5250_HW3/ys5250_HW3.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Develop a model to predict customer churn and identify effective strategies to enhance customer retention at a telecommunications company.

**Business Impact**:
- **Customer Retention**: Directly supports strategic initiatives to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty.
- **Marketing ROI**: Optimizes marketing spend by targeting retention efforts on high-risk customers, improving return on investment.
- **Long-term Profitability**: Enhances profitability through increased customer lifetime value and reduced cost of customer acquisition.

**Key Data Science Techniques**:
- Logistic Regression for estimating churn probability based on customer behavior and demographics.
- Ensemble techniques, specifically Random Forest, to handle complex interactions and improve prediction.
- Economic analysis to quantify the impact of retention strategies and ensure they are cost-effective.
